# Build smart contract

This educational journey equipped me with a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. By completing practical tasks and sharing updates on GitHub, I acquired hands-on experience and built a demonstrative portfolio. I mastered the creation of ERC20 tokens, the management of blockchain-stored hashed messages, and the automation of smart contract interactions with ethers.js. Additionally, I explored zkSync and paymasters for handling transaction fees and managing token balances.
